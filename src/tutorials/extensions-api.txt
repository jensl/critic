Critic Extensions API
=====================

Basic Usage
-----------

This API is available to extension scripts as the module "critic" on which
constructors and interface objects are exposed as properties.  The constructor
for the User interface is accessible to extension scripts as "critic.User", for
instance.

Basic Data Types
----------------

CriticError
-----------
| exception CriticError : Error {
| };

Thrown by other functions when called with incorrect arguments or similar.
Native ECMAScript exceptions such as TypeError or ReferenceError may also be
thrown.

User
----
| interface Filter {
|   long       id;
|   User       user;
|   Repository repository;
|   string     path;
|   string     type;
|   User[]     delegates;
| };
|
| interface User {
|   dictionary UserData {
|     long   id;
|     string name;
|     string email;
|   };
|
|   constructor User(UserData data);
|   constructor User(string name);
|   constructor User(long id);
|
|   readonly attribute long   id;
|   readonly attribute string name;
|   readonly attribute string email;
|   readonly attribute string fullname;
|
|   static readonly attribute User current;
|
|   boolean|long|string getPreference(string name);
|
|   Filter[] getFilters(Repository repository);
|   Filter addFilter(Repository repository, string path, string type, string? delegates);
| };

Simple object representing a Critic user.  The getPreference method can be used
to access the user's preferences; it returns a value of type boolean, long or
string depending on the preference.  The getFilters method can be used to list
the user's global filters for a given repository and the addFilter method can be
used to add a new global filter for a user.  Note: adding a new filter does not
cause changes in existing reviews to be assigned to the user.

An extension can fetch user records from the database simply by constructing
User objects, supplying either the user name or a user ID number; "new
critic.User('jl')" or "new critic.User(18)".

The current user (the user who installed the extension and is currently loading
a page, pushing changes or whatever triggered the extension) is always
accessible as "critic.User.current".

File
------------------
| interface File {
|   readonly attribute long      id;
|   readonly attribute string    path;
|
|   string toString();
|   long valueOf();
|
|   static File find(string path);
|   static File find(long id);
| };

Object representing a file.  Exist in Critic primarily as a means to assign
system-wide ID numbers to paths, and are used throughout the Critic extensions
API for representing paths.  The toString() methods return the value of the
'path' attribute, and the valueOf() methods return the value of the 'id'
attribute.

The 'path' attribute of a File object has no leading forward slash (and of
course no trailing one either.)

The find() methods will return the same object if called multiple times to find
the same object (whether via path or ID.)

Git Repository Access
---------------------

GitObject
---------
| interface GitObject {
|   readonly attribute string     sha1;
|   readonly attribute string     type;
|   readonly attribute Uint8Array data;
| };

Raw representation of an object fetched from the Git repository.

GitUserTime
-----------
| interface GitUserTime {
|   readonly attribute string fullname;
|   readonly attribute string email;
|   readonly attribute Date   time;
|   readonly attribute User?  user;
| };

Representation of the information in the "author" and "committer" fields in a
Git commit object.

Repository
----------
| interface Repository {
|   constructor Repository(string name);
|   constructor Repository(long id);
|
|   readonly attribute long   id;
|   readonly attribute string name;
|   readonly attribute string path;
|
|   interface Filter {
|     readonly attribute User       user;
|     readonly attribute string     path;
|     readonly attribute string     type;
|     readonly attribute User[]     delegates;
|   };
|
|   readonly attribute Filter[] filters;
|
|   GitObject fetch(string sha1);
|   string    revparse(string ref);
|
|   Commit    getCommit(string ref);
|   Commit    getCommit(long id);
|
|   Branch    getBranch(string name);
|
|   Changeset getChangeset(string ref);
|   Changeset getChangeset(Commit commit);
|   Changeset getChangeset(string a, string b);
|   Changeset getChangeset(Commit a, Commit b);
|   Changeset getChangeset(long id);
|
|   RepositoryWorkCopy
|             getWorkCopy();
| };

Representation of one of Critic's repositories.  Can be constructed supplying
either the repository's "short name" or its ID.

The 'filters' attribute returns an array of all user filters registered for the
repository.  The array object also has the properties 'users' and 'paths', that
returns dictionaries mapping user names and paths to filtered arrays of filters,
respectively.  The full array and all the filtered arrays combined contain the
same set of filters.  The 'path' attribute on filter objects define what set of
the tree is being filtered.  The value of the 'type' attribute on filter objects
is one of the strings "reviewer" and "watcher".

The fetch() method can be used to read low-level objects from the Git
repository.  Using this function is usually not necessary.  Its argument must be
a full 40 character SHA-1 sum.

The revparse() method can be used to interpret a Git ref name and convert it to
a full 40 character SHA-1 sum.  This function runs the command "git rev-parse
--verify --quiet <ref>" and will thus fail for any argument that isn't "usable
as a single, valid object name" according to Git.

The getCommit() method can be used to fetch Commit objects, either specifying a
string (which is interpreted using revparse()) or a Critic commit ID.

The getBranch() method can be used to fetch Branch objects, either specifying a
string (which must be the exact ref name, minus the "refs/heads/" prefix) or a
Critic branch ID.

The getChangeset() method can be used to fetch an object representing the diff
between two commits.  The arguments can be one commit, two commits or a Critic
changeset ID.  Commit arguments can be specified either as strings (which are
interpreted using revparse()) or as Commit objects.

The getWorkCopy() method can be used to create or access a work-copy clone of
this repository.

RepositoryWorkCopy
------------------
| interface RepositoryWorkCopy {
|   readonly attribute Repository repository;
|   readonly attribute string     path;
|
|   string run(string command, ..., Object? environment);
| };

Representation of a work-copy clone of a repository.  Work-copys are
semi-persistent and can be reused by different invokations of an extension, but
are never shared between users or between extensions.  An extension should not
depend on changes made in a work-copy remaining for more than 24 hours, and if
possible, shouldn't depend on them to remain between invokations of the
extension at all.

The "path" attribute is the absolute file system path of the repository, without
a trailing slash.

The run() method can be used to execute arbitrary git commands in the
repository.  The first argument should be the name of the git command, such as
"status" or "commit".  Additional arguments are passed as options to the git
command.  If the last argument to the function is an object, it is not passed as
an regular argument to the git command, instead its enumerable properties are
set as environment variables for the git command.  Input can be passed to the
git command's stdin by setting the special environment variable "stdin" (which
is not actually set as an environment variable.)

When a work-copy clone is reused, it's always cleaned up by running "git clean
-x -d -f -f" and "git reset --hard HEAD" in it.

Commit
------
| interface Commit {
|   readonly attribute Repository  repository;
|   readonly attribute long        id;
|   readonly attribute string      sha1;
|   readonly attribute string      tree;
|   readonly attribute GitUserTime author;
|   readonly attribute GitUserTime committer;
|   readonly attribute string      message;
|   readonly attribute string      summary;
|   readonly attribute Commit[]    parents;
|
|   CommitFileVersion getFile(string path);
| };

Representation of a Git commit.

The "tree" attribute contains the SHA-1 sum of the tree object that the commit
references.

The "summary" attribute contains either the first line of the commit message,
or, if that line starts with either "fixup!" or "squash!" and is followed by at
least one non-empty line, the first non-empty line following the first line.

The getFile() method can be used to access an arbitrary file as it appears in
the commit.  The file need not have been modified in the commit.

FileVersion
-----------
| interface FileVersion : File {
|   readonly Repository repository;
|   readonly string     mode;
|   readonly long       size;
|   readonly string     sha1;
|
|   readonly Uint8Array bytes;
|   readonly string[]?  lines;
| };
|
| interface CommitFileVersion : FileVersion {
|   readonly Commit     commit;
| };

Representation of a version of a certain file in a repository.  The "mode"
attribute is a string containing 6 digits, usually "100644".  The three last
digits represent the access bits (R, W and X) for user, group and others,
respectively.  The "size" attribute is the size of the file in bytes.  The
"sha1" attribute is the SHA-1 sum of the blob object in the repository.

The "bytes" attribute contains the file version's contents as an Uint8Array
object.  The "lines" attribute contains the file version's contents as an array
of lines, or null if the file is heuristically determined to contain binary data
(the heuristics are the same as git uses.)  The raw contents of the file are
interpreted as UTF-8 and if that does not work, as ISO-8859-1.

CommitSet
---------
| interface CommitSet : Array {
|   constructor CommitSet(Commit[] commits);
|
|   readonly attribute long     length;
|   readonly attribute Object   parents;
|   readonly attribute Object   children;
|   readonly attribute Commit[] heads;
|   readonly attribute Commit[] tails;
|   readonly attribute Commit[] upstreams;
| };

Representation of a set of commits.  The object is first of all an array of
Commit objects, in depth-first first-parent-first order, starting from the head
commits of the set in unspecified order.  (In sets with multiple heads, parents
can occur before their children, so in such sets, the order should not be relied
upon to be strictly topological.)  For each commit in the set, the object also
has a non-enumerable property whose name is the SHA-1 sum of the commit and
whose value is the Commit object.

The parents and children attributes are objects with one property per commit in
the set whose name is the SHA-1 sum of the commit and whose value is an array of
Commit objects, containing the parents and children of the commit in the set,
respectively.  (IOW, if a commit has multiple parents, some included in the set
and some not included in the set, this array contains only those parents that
are in the set.  The commit object's parents attribute returns an array
containing the commit's full set of parents.)

The heads attribute is an array of Commit objects that contains all commits in
the set that has no descendants in the set.  The array also has a
non-enumerable property per such commit whose name is the SHA-1 sum of the
commit and whose value is the Commit object.

The tails attribute is an array of Commit objects that contains all commits that
are parents of commits included in the commit-set but are not included in the
commit-set themselves.  The array also has a non-enumerable property per such
commit whose name is the SHA-1 sum of the commit and whose value is the Commit
object.

The upstreams attribute is an array of Commit objects that contains all commits
in the tails array that aren't ancestors of another commit in the tails array.
If the commit-set contains the commits on a branch, and the branch has been
merged with its upstream branch (e.g. 'master') a number of times, the tails
array would contain each commit from the upstream branch that was merged in,
whereas the upstreams array would only contain one -- the commit that was merged
in most recently.

Note: A commit-set representing a simple branch of commits without any merges
will have a heads array containing a single commit and a tails array containing
a single commit.  Multiple tails indicate that the commit-set includes merges
that merge in commits that are not included in the commit-set.  Multiple heads
typically indicate that the commit-set consists of multiple disconnected
sub-trees of commits, such as the commits that make up a review that has been
rebased one or more times.

Branch
------
| dictionary BranchData {
|   long id;
|
|   Repository repository;
|   string     name;
| };
|
| interface Branch {
|   constructor Branch(BranchData data);
|
|   readonly attribute Repository repository;
|   readonly attribute long       id;
|   readonly attribute string     name;
|   readonly attribute Commit     head;
|   readonly attribute Branch?    base;
|   readonly attribute Review?    review;
|   readonly attribute CommitSet  commits;
|
|   RepositoryWorkCopy getWorkCopy();
| };

Representation of Critic's view of a branch.  This is somewhat different from
Git's normal view of a branch in that a branch is considered to be based on
(branched from) another branch, and doesn't contain commits it has in common
with its base branch.  For each repository, however, there is a root branch
(typically 'master') that contains the same set of commits in Critic's view of
it as in Git's normal view.  This root branch has no base branch.

The review attribute returns a Review object representing the review associated
with this branch.  If this branch is a review branch, the associated review is
the review whose review branch this is.  Otherwise, the associated review is the
latest review created from this branch, if any.  If there is no associated
review, the attribute is null.

The commits attribute returns a CommitSet object containing all commits that
Critic considers part of the branch.  This set's heads array contains a single
commit which is the same as the commit returned from the Branch object's head
attribute.  The set's tails array may contain multiple commits, if the branch
contains merges.

The getWorkCopy() method can be used to create a work-copy of the repository
containing this branch.  The work-copy's "origin" remote will be the repository
containing this branch.  The work-copy's current branch will have the same name
as this branch, and will be set up to track this branch in "origin".

TrackedBranch
-------------
| dictionary FindData {
|   Branch branch;
|
|   string remote;
|   string name;
| };
|
| interface TrackedBranch {
|   readonly attribute Branch branch;
|   readonly attribute Review? review;
|   readonly attribute string remote;
|   readonly attribute string name;
|
|   readonly attribute boolean disabled;
|   readonly attribute boolean pending;
|   readonly attribute boolean updating;
|
|   static TrackedBranch find(FindData data);
| };

Representation of a tracked branch.  The branch attribute represents the local
branch.  The review attribute is the review connected with the local branch, if
there is one, and null otherwise.  The remote and name attributes represent the
remote repository and branch name.

The disabled attribute indicates whether the tracking is disabled.  The pending
attribute indicates whether the branch will be updated ASAP.  The updating
attribute indicates whether the branch is being updated right now.

Changesets
----------

Changeset
---------
| interface Changeset {
|   readonly attribute Repository      repository;
|   readonly attribute Review?         review;
|   readonly attribute long            id;
|   readonly attribute Commit          parent;
|   readonly attribute Commit          child;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetFile[] files;
|   readonly attribute Commit[]        commits;
| };

Represents the collection of changes to files between two commits; parent and
child.  The files attribute is an array containing all changed files.

MergeChangeset
--------------
| interface MergeChangeset {
|   readonly attribute Repository  repository;
|   readonly attribute Review?     review;
|   readonly attribute Commit      commit;
|   readonly attribute Changeset[] changesets;
| };

Represents the relevance-filtered changes in a merge commit.  The changesets
attribute is an array of Changeset objects, one for each parent of the commit
returned by the commit attribute.  Note that these changesets do not contain the
full set of changes between the merge commit and its parents; they only contain
changes that are deemed likely to have caused conflicts.

ChangesetFile
-------------
| interface ChangesetFile : File {
|   readonly attribute Changeset             changeset;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetFileVersion? oldVersion;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetFileVersion? newVersion;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetChunk[]?     chunks;
|   readonly attribute long                  deleteCount;
|   readonly attribute long                  insertCount;
|
|   readonly attribute boolean?              isReviewed;
|   readonly attribute User?                 reviewedBy;
| };

Represents a file changed in a changeset.  The chunks attribute is an array of
chunks, each representing a sequence of changed lines.  If a file was added or
removed in the changeset, oldVersion or newVersion is null, respectively, and
the chunks attribute is null.

The deleteCount and insertCount attributes are the total number of lines deleted
and inserted in the file in the changeset, respectively.

If the parent Changeset object (returned by the changeset attribute) was fetched
from a Review object (using the Review.getChangeset method), the attribute
isReviewed is set to true if these changes in this file have been marked as
reviewed, and the reviewedBy attribute is set to the user who (most recently)
marked the file as reviewed.  If the parent Changeset object was not fetched
from a Review object, both properties are null.

ChangesetFileVersion
--------------------
| interface ChangesetFileVersion : FileVersion {
|   readonly attribute Changeset     changeset;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetFile file;
| };

Represents a single version of a file changed in the changeset.

ChangesetChunk
--------------
| interface ChangesetChunk {
|   readonly attribute Changeset       changeset;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetFile   file;
|   readonly attribute long            deleteOffset;
|   readonly attribute long            deleteCount;
|   readonly attribute long            insertOffset;
|   readonly attribute long            insertCount;
|   readonly attribute ChangesetLine[] lines;
| };

Represents a continuous set of changed lines.

The offset attributes deleteOffset and insertOffset represent the start line
(zero-based) of the modification; either the first deleted or first inserted
line.  If deleteCount or insertCount is zero, the line specified by the
corresponding offset is the first line after the changes.  A zero deleteCount
means lines were only inserted and a zero insertCount means lines were only
deleted; both counts will never be zero.

The lines attribute is an array of lines from a hypothetical side-by-side diff.
It is possible for this array to contain more elements than deleteCount or
insertCount.  The maximum possible number of elements is
deleteCount+insertCount, and the minimum possible number of elements is
MAX(deleteCount,insertCount).

ChangesetLine
-------------
| interface ChangesetLine {
|   const long TYPE_CONTEXT    = 0;
|   const long TYPE_WHITESPACE = 1;
|   const long TYPE_REPLACED   = 2;
|   const long TYPE_MODIFIED   = 3;
|   const long TYPE_DELETED    = 4;
|   const long TYPE_INSERTED   = 5;
|
|   const long OPERATION_REPLACE = 0;
|   const long OPERATION_DELETE  = 1;
|   const long OPERATION_INSERT  = 2;
|
|   readonly attribute long     type;
|   readonly attribute long     oldIndex;
|   readonly attribute string?  oldText;
|   readonly attribute long     newIndex;
|   readonly attribute string?  newText;
|   readonly attribute Array[]? operations;
| };

Representation of a line in a hypothetical side-by-side diff.  The type of the
line represents the line's role in the diff.  Context lines aren't changed at
all, whitespace lines have only whitespace changes, replaced lines are lines
where there are few similarities between the old and new versions, modified
lines are lines where there are enough similarities between the old and new
version to assume the line was edited (in which case the operations attribute
contains an analysis of how the line was edited), and deleted and inserted lines
are lines that are only present in the old or new version, respectively.
(Technically, a replaced line is really just a deleted line and an inserted line
collapsed together.)

The operations attribute returns an array of arrays.  Each array represents a
modification of the line.  The first element of each array is the modification
type; replace, delete or insert.  In the case of replace, the array contains an
additional four elements; deleteStart, deleteEnd, insertStart and insertEnd; and
the meaning is that the characters [deleteStart,deleteEnd) in the old version of
the line (oldText) were replaced by the characters [insertStart,insertEnd) in
the new version of the line (newText).  In the case of delete or insert, the
array contains an additional two elements; start and end; and the meaning is
that the characters [start,end) were deleted from the old version (delete) or
inserted into the new version (insert).

Reviews
-------

Review
------
| interface Review {
|   constructor Review(long id);
|
|   readonly attribute long           id;
|   readonly attribute string         state;
|   readonly attribute User           owner;
|   readonly attribute User?          closedBy;
|   readonly attribute User?          droppedBy;
|   readonly attribute string         summary;
|   readonly attribute string         description;
|   readonly attribute Repository     repository;
|   readonly attribute Branch         branch;
|   readonly attribute CommitSet      commits;
|   readonly attribute User[]         users;
|   readonly attribute Object         reviewers;
|   readonly attribute Object         watchers;
|   readonly attribute CommentChain[] commentChains;
|   readonly attribute OldBatch[]     batches;
|   readonly attribute ReviewFilter[] filters;
|   readonly attribute ReviewProgress progress;
|   readonly attribute TrackedBranch  trackedBranch;
|
|   OldBatch getBatch(long id);
|
|   CommentChain getCommentChain(long id);
|   Comment getComment(long id);
|
|   Changeset|MergeChangeset getChangeset(Commit commit);
|
|   NewBatch startBatch(User acting_user);
|
|   dictionary PrepareRebaseData {
|     boolean historyRewrite;
|     boolean singleCommit;
|     Commit newUpstream;
|
|     string branch;
|   };
|
|   void prepareRebase(PrepareRebaseData data);
|   void cancelRebase();
| };

The prepareRebase() method prepares the review to rebased.  This is the same
operation as is performed using the "Prepare Rebase" button on the review
front-page.  Exactly one of data.historyRewrite, data.singleCommit and
data.newUpstream needs to be set (true / non-null) to indicate the type of
rebase.  A history rewrite rebase is only allowed to change the commit history,
not the tree.  A move rebase, indicated by data.singleCommit or
data.newUpstream, is allowed to change the tree as well.  If data.singleCommit
is true, the new upstream is implicitly the parent commit of the new head of the
branch, otherwise data.newUpstream must be set accordingly.  (See the tutorial
on review rebasing for more details.)

The cancelRebase() method cancels a previous prepared (but not yet performed)
rebase.  While a rebase is prepared, no-one but the user who prepared the rebase
is allowed to push to the review branch, and no other user can prepare a rebase
of the review.  Thus, if a rebase is prepared but won't be performed, it should
be cancelled instead.

ReviewFilter
------------
| interface ReviewFilter {
|   readonly attribute Review     review;
|   readonly attribute string     type;
|   readonly attribute User       user;
|   readonly attribute string     path;
|   readonly attribute User       creator;
| };

--------------
| interface ReviewProgress {
|   readonly attribute boolean accepted;
|   readonly attribute boolean finished;
|   readonly attribute boolean dropped;

|   readonly attribute long    openIssues;
|
|   string toString();
| };

|   void unassignChanges(User assignee, ChangesetFile changeset);
|
|   void addReviewFilter(User user, string type, string path);
|   void removeReviewFilter(User user, string type, string path);
|
|   dictionary FinishData {
|     string text;
|     boolean silent;
|   };
|
|   void finish(FinishData? data);
| };

Object used to collect changes to submit to a review, and then submit them.
Each batch can only manipulate one review on behalf of one user, and is started
using the method Review.startBatch().  Until finish() is called, nothing is
added to the database at all.  When finish() is called, everything is added to
the database, and mails are sent to relevant users.

ReviewSet
---------
| interface ReviewSet {
| };

The ReviewSet interface is a small utility interface used by the Dashboard
interface to represent a set of reviews.  For each review in the set, the
ReviewSet object has one enumerable property whose name is the review ID and
whose value is the Review object.

Dashboard
---------
| interface Dashboard {
|   readonly attribute User user;
|
|   interface Owned {
|     readonly attribute Review[] finished;
|     readonly attribute Review[] accepted;
|     readonly attribute Review[] pending;
|     readonly attribute Review[] dropped;
|   };
|
|   interface Active : Review[] {
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet hasPendingChanges;
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet hasUnreadComments;
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet isReviewer;
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet isWatcher;
|   };
|
|   interface Inactive : Review[] {
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet isReviewer;
|     readonly attribute ReviewSet isWatcher;
|   };
|
|   readonly attribute Owned    owned;
|   readonly attribute Active   active;
|   readonly attribute Inactive inactive;
| };

The Dashboard interface exposes various sets of reviews with which the user is
associated, roughly corresponding to those displayed on the built-in dashboard
page.

The owned attribute returns a sub-object containing four arrays of reviews owned
by the user, one array per review state: finished, accepted, pending and
dropped.  These arrays are non-overlapping.  (The reviews in the finished and
dropped arrays are not displayed on the built-in dashboard page.)

The active attribute returns an array of open (accepted or pending) reviews that
are "active," which actually rather means the user ought to be active; that is,
in which there is work for the user to do.  This array can contain reviews owned
by the user.  The array also has four additional attributes that return
ReviewSet objects containing sub-sets of the array.  The hasPendingChanges set
contains reviews in which there are unreviewed changes assigned to the user.
The hasUnreadComments set contains reviews in which the user has unread
comments.  These sets can overlap.  The isReviewer and isWatcher sets contain
reviews in which the user is a reviewer (has changes assigned to him, already
reviewed or not) and those in which the user is not a reviewer.  These sets
don't overlap, and together they contain all reviews in the array.

The inactive attribute returns an array of all open reviews with which the user
is associated that were not included in the array returned by the active
attribute.  The isReviewer and isWatcher attributes work the same way as the
corresponding attributes on the array return by the active attribute.

Filters
-------
| interface Filters {
|   dictionary FiltersInit {
|     Repository   repository;
|     Review       review;
|     User         user;
|   };
|
|   constructor Filters(FiltersInit data);
|
|   readonly attribute Repository repository;
|   readonly attribute Review?    review;
|
|   boolean isReviewer(User user, File file);
|   boolean isWatcher(User user, File file);
|   boolean isRelevant(User user, File file);
|
|   Object listUsers(File file);
| };

The Filters interface provides easy access to Critic's filtering system,
applying global filters, inherited global filters and review filters.

If FiltersInit.review is set, FiltersInit.repository is ignored (the repository
is inferred from the review instead.)  If FiltersInit.review is not set,
FiltersInit.repository must be set.

If FiltersInit.user is set, only filters relating to that user are loaded.  This
is an optimization for the case that only a single user's filters is of
interest.

The isReviewer() and isWatcher() functions return true if the provided user is a
reviewer or watcher, respectively, of the provided file.  The isRelevant()
function returns true if the provided user is either a reviewer or a watcher of
the provided file.

The listUsers() function returns the set of users that either review or watch
the provided file.  The returned object has one enumerable property per user in
the set whose name is the user ID and whose value is a User object.

Per-user Data Storage
---------------------

Storage
-------
| interface Storage {
|   constructor Storage(User user);
|
|   string get(string key);
|   void set(string key, string value);
| };

The Storage interface provides a simple key/value storage.  The length of the
key is limited to 64 characters, the value can be an arbitrarily long string.
To store more complex data, the builtin JSON encoder (JSON.stringify()) and JSON
decoder (JSON.parse()) can be used.

A storage object accessing data for the current extension and current user is
available as "critic.storage".  Storage objects accessing data for the current
extension and an arbitrary user can be constructed using "new
critic.Storage(user)".

Per-user Log
------------

Log
---
| interface Log {
|   constructor Log(User user);
|
|   dictionary WriteData {
|     string category;
|   };
|
|   void write(...[, WriteData data]);
|
|   dictionary SearchData {
|     Date|string timeStart;
|     Date|string timeEnd;
|     string category;
|   };
|
|   interface Entry {
|     User user;
|     Date time;
|     string category;
|     string text;
|   };
|
|   Entry[] fetch(SearchData data);
|   void remove(SearchData data);
| };

The Log interface provides a simple per-extension and per-user logging facility.
Each log entry consists of a timestamp, a category (an arbitrary string of no
more than 64 characters) and the text (an arbitrarily long string.)

Entries are added to the log using the write() method.  If the last parameter to
it is an object, it is used as a WriteData dictionary instance, and does not
contribute to the text logged.  The dictionary can be used to set the category
of the log entry.  If not set, the category defaults to "default".  The rest of
the arguments are passed to the built-in format() function.

Entries from the log can be fetched using the fetch() method and removed using
the remove() function.  Both functions take an optional SearchData dictionary
argument, which can be used to select specific entries.  If the timeStart member
is specified, only entries written since the specified point in time are
selected.  If the timeEnd member is specified, only entries written before the
specified point in time are selected.  Both members can be either a Date object
for an absolute time or a string on the form "N unit(s)", such as "1 month" or
"5 hours", for a relative time.  If the category member is specified, only
entries with that category are selected.

A log object logging for the current extension and current user is available as
"critic.log".  Log objects logging for the current extension and an arbitrary
user can be constructed using "new critic.Log(user)".

Statistics
----------

Statistics
----------
| interface Statistics {
|   constructor Statistics();
|
|   void setReview(Review review);
|
|   void setInterval(Date start[, Date end]);
|   void setInterval(string start[, string end]);
|
|   void setUser(User user);
|
|   void addDirectory(string path);
|   void addFile(string path);
|
|   Object getReviewedLines();
|   Object getWrittenComments();
| };

The Statistics interface allows extraction of simply statistics data.  The
database queries issued by this interface can take a long time to complete,
especially when not filtering per review or user, and if the time interval is
large.  It may take 30 seconds or more for getReviewedLines() to return.

The setReview() method restricts the query to a single review.  If no review is
set, the query applies to all reviews (in all repositories.)

The setInterval() method restricts the query to a certain period of time.  Start
and end points are specified as Date objects, or as strings on the form "N
unit(s)", such as "1 month", "2 weeks" or "12 hours".  Supported units are
seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years.  The end point is
optional; if not set, it defaults to the current time.

The setUser() method restricts the query to a certain user.

The addDirectory() method restricts the query to files under one or more
directories.

The getReviewedLines() method executes a query counting the number of lines
marked as reviewed by each user.  The returned object has one property per user
in the query result whose name is the user ID and whose value is an object with
the properties deleteCount and insertCount.  A simple enumeration of the query
results could look something like

| var data = statistics.getReviewedLines();
| for (var user_id in data)
| {
|   var user = new critic.User({ id: user_id });
|   var lines = data[user_id];
|   writeln("%%s has reviewed %%d lines", user.fullname, lines.deleteCount + lines.insertCount);
| }

Note: the user_id variable in this code contains the user ID, which is really an
integer, but since it comes from a property enumeration, the variable's type is
string.  Calling critic.User(user_id) directly would not work, since it will
interpret its argument as a user name when it's a string, hence the variant
critic.User({ id: user_id }).  Using parseInt(user_id) to convert the user ID to
a number would have worked too, of course.

The getWrittenComments() method executes a query counting the number of comments
written by each user.  It's similar to getReviewedLines(), except the per-user
data objects have the properties raisedIssues, writtenNotes, totalComments and
totalCharacters.  The totalComments property is the sum of raisedIssues and
writtenNotes, plus the number of replies written.  The totalCharacters property
is the sum of the lengths of each comment counted by totalComments.

HTML Utilities
--------------

Utilities for generating pages that look like other Critic pages are available
in a sub-module accessible as "critic.html", for instancce
"critic.html.writeStandardHeader()" and "new critic.html.PaleYellowTable()".

writeStandardHeader()
---------------------
| dictionary HeaderData {
|   User   user;
|   Array  stylesheets;
|   Array  scripts;
|   Object links;
|   Review review;
| };
|
| void writeStandardHeader(string title, HeaderData? data);

Writes a document header.  This will write a DOCTYPE, start the HTML element,
write a HEAD element with TITLE, default external stylesheets and scripts,
additional external stylesheets and scripts specified in the data argument, and
then start the BODY element and write a TABLE element containing the visible
page header (the Critic logo and navigation links.)  Additional content written
after the call to this function will be parsed into the BODY element.

The data.user attribute controls which user's preferences and other state (such
as unread news items) is used to render the page header.  If not specified, it
defaults to the user loading the page being generated.

The data.stylesheets and data.scripts arrays should contain URLs as strings.

The data.links object is enumerated and one link is added for every enumerable
property.  If the name of the property starts with "rel=", a LINK element is
added to the HEAD element, otherwise a regular link whose title is the name of
the property is added to the page header (next to the "Home", "Dashboard",
"Branches" et c. links).  The value of the property is used as the link's HREF
in both cases.

The data.review object, if set, adds a standard "Back To Review" link, and adds
draft changes summary and Submit/Preview/Abort buttons to the right side of the
header, if the user has any unsubmitted changes in the review.

A call to writeStandardHeader() might look something like

| critic.html.writeStandardHeader("Page Title", {
|     links: { "rel=up": "/dashboard",
|              "BTS": "https://bugs.opera.com/" }
|     stylesheets: ["/extension-resource/HelloWorld/custom.css"],
|     scripts: ["/extension-resource/HelloWorld/custom.js"]
|   });

writeStandardFooter()
---------------------
| dictionary FooterData {
|   User user;
| };
|
| void writeStandardFooter(FooterData? data);

Writes a document footer that adds a little bit of content and closes the BODY
and HTML elements.

escape()
--------
| string escape(string text);

Replaces all characters in the argument string that have special meaning in HTML
with HTML entity references, so that it can safely be written as text or in an
attribute value.  (This is a trivial conversion, of course, and is exposed
merely as convenience.)

PaleYellowTable
---------------
| interface PaleYellowTable {
|   constructor PaleYellowTable(string title);
|
|   void addHeading(string heading);
|
|   dictionary StandardItem {
|     string name;
|     string value;
|     string description;
|     Object buttons;
|   };
|   dictionary ButtonsItem {
|     Object buttons;
|   };
|   dictionary CustomItem {
|     string html;
|   };
|
|   void addItem(StandardItem item);
|   void addItem(ButtonsItem item);
|   void addItem(CustomItem item);
|
|   void write();
| };

The PaleYellowTable interface can be used to generate typical Critic "pale
yellow tables."  The title argument to the constructor is the main title of the
table.  Additional headings can be added using the addHeading() methods.
Regular content in the table is added using the addItem() method.

When the addItem() method is called with an argument matching the StandardItem
dictionary, a fixed-form item is added, which produces a result similar to the
first table on a review front-page, containing basic information about the
review.  The buttons attribute in the dictionary is optional; if present, the
object's properties are enumerated and a button is added for each, whose title
is the name of the property, and whose onclick attribute value is the value of
the property.  All strings except the value (name, description, and button title
and onclick handler) will have characters with special meaning in HTML replaced
by entity references, and thus can't contain HTML styling.  The value string is
output as-is, and should be escaped using critic.html.escape() (or similar) if
its content is unknown and shouldn't be interpreted as HTML.

When the addItem() method is called with an argument matching the ButtonsItem
dictionary, a row of buttons is added.  The object is handled the same way as
StandardItem.buttons described above.

When the addItem() method is called with an argument matching the CustomItem
dictionary, the value of the html attribute is output as-is (without escaping)
inside a full-width table cell.

The write() method writes all HTML for the whole table to stdout using the
built-in (global) write() function.  This means several PaleYellowTable objects
can be constructed and populated in parallel, and then all written (in some
order) at the end.
