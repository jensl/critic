Branch Review Status Analyzer
=============================

Commit Status
-------------

Critic's automatic branch review status analyzer is designed to answer the
question "If branch A was merged into branch B, would any unreviewed changes be
merged?"  In the typical use-case, "A" would be a task branch, and "B" would be
master.

To analyze a branch, visit the
  <a href=checkbranch>/checkbranch</a>
page, enter the name of the branch to check, select the repository in which it
lives, optionally request that the branch be fetched from the repository's
upstream repository (on <code>git.oslo.osa</code> or <code>dvcs.oslo.osa</code>,)
and then press the "Check" button.

The list of commits that would be merged is calculated using
  <code>git rev-list</code>;
the exact command used is included on the result page.

The review status of the branch is calculated per commit, and is signalled using
the colors green, yellow and red.

Green
-----
A green commit status means that the commit is verified by Critic to have been
reviewed in an accepted review in Critic.  To be assigned this status, one of
these two statements must be true about the commit:

1 The commit is the same as the head commit on the review branch (same SHA-1)
2 The commit is included on the review branch, and is the parent of another
  green commit from the same review.

The meaning of the second point is simply that if the head commit of an accepted
review is among the checked commits, then all other commits from that review are
also green.  It also means that if the head commit of an accepted review is not
among the checked commits, then no other commits from the review will be green,
even if they are exactly the same commits (same SHA-1); this is because the
changes that were accepted in the review were exactly all the changes, not just
some of them.  Trying to merge only some of the commits from the review can't be
verified by Critic as a safe operation, since it might mean that you are
accidentally trying to merge an incomplete set of changes, for instance missing
fixes for all review issues.

Yellow
------
A yellow commit status means that the commit has been manually connected to a
review, or had its review status otherwise explained, by a user.  This might
mean that the commit is a squash of the changes in a review, but that a strong
SHA-1-based connection can't be made by Critic because the review hasn't been
rebased, or can't be rebased.  It could also mean that the changes in the commit
were reviewed outside of Critic.

Red
---
A red commit status either means that Critic hasn't been able to connect the
commit to a review at all, or that the review to which the commit has been
connected isn't accepted or finished.

That the commit hasn't been connected to a review does not conclusively mean the
commit hasn't been reviewed, it just means Critic can't say anything for sure
about it.  Since Critic requires the same SHA-1 to automatically match a review
to a commit, simply cherry-picking a commit from a review branch to the checked
branch will always make it show up as red, even if the cherry-pick was
conflict-free and the commit message is identical.


Usage
-----

The only way in which one needs to interact with the branch review status page
is by manually connecting commits to reviews when Critic can't make the
connection automatically, or otherwise explain how a commit was reviewed.  To do
this, every non-green commit has an <code>[edit]</code> link in the right-most
column.  Red commits committed by the user looking at the
  <code>/checkbranch</code>
are highlighted in red for visibility.

The <code>[edit]</code> link opens up a dialog.  This dialog has an input field
for entering the ID number of a review, and a text area for writing a comment.
Also, if Critic finds any reviews that seem like likely candidates to have
contained the changes in the commit, the dialog also contains a drop-down
containing those candidate reviews.  Selecting an item in the drop-down simply
sets the review ID input field's value.

Entering a comment is optional if a review ID is specified.  If no review ID is
specified, for instance because the changes were reviewed outside of Critic, a
comment is required.  The comment should just be a very short explanation for
how the changes were reviewed.

Review Rebase
-------------
If the ID number of a review is entered, Critic will automatically check if it
would be possible to rebase the review to contain this single commit.  Doing so
would make the commit appear green and is always preferable to having it appear
yellow, since green means Critic has verified that the commit contains exactly
the same changes as the ones that were approved in the review, and thus
eliminates the possibility of the wrong changes having been pushed to the branch
by mistake.

<b>Note:</b> It's important to only accept the offer to rebase the review if the
commit is a squash of all changes in the review.  If the commit is only part of
the review, for instance a cherry-pick of a single bug fix made on a larger task
branch, rebasing the review would be a very bad idea.  But since the green
commit status is a much stronger guarantee that the right changes made it onto
the branch, it's strongly recommended that the branch is rebased whenever
possible, so that the commit appears green.
