Rebasing a Review
=================

Rebase Types
------------

Critic's review rebase functionality handles two limited types of rebase:

1 In-place rebase
2 Move rebase

The first type is typically used to clean-up or rewrite the history of the
branch, without changing the branch's upstream commit (the parent commit of the
first commit in the review.)  Typically, such a rebase doesn't change the state
of the source tree as it is at the head of the branch; it only changes how it
came to be that way.  Critic in fact requires that this type of rebase doesn't
change the tree.

The second type is typically used to update to a newer version of the upstream
branch.  Because the source tree onto which the review's changes are applied
changes with this type of review, it can typically not produce an identical
tree.  Critic doesn't require that for this type of rebase, instead it only
requires the new upstream commit to be a descendant of the old upstream commit,
and that you tell it in advance which new upstream commit you're rebasing onto.

Preparing to Rebase
-------------------

To perform either kind of rebase, you must first visit the review's front-page
and press the button labelled "Prepare Rebase" that is placed at the bottom of
the table titled "Commits."  Without being told in advance that you intend to
rebase a review, Critic will reject all non-fast-forward updates.

Pressing the button opens a dialog that asks you to select which type of rebase
you're planning.  Once the process of preparing the review for a rebase is
completed, only a valid rebase push is accepted, and only by you.  If other
users try to push to the review branch, their pushes will be rejected, even if
they are plain fast-forward updates, or correct rebases.  If you change your
mind, there's a button labelled "Cancel Rebase" on the review front-page where
the "Prepare Rebase" button used to be.

In-place Rebase
---------------

By selecting the "History Rewrite / In-place" alternative in the dialog and
pressing the "Continue" button, the process of preparing for an in-place rebase
is complete, and a dialog telling you that will be displayed.  You can now go
ahead and push the rebased branch using

  <code>git push -f critic HEAD:r/&lt;name&gt;</code>

(the "-f" argument is required since Git otherwise rejects all non-fast-forward
updates.)

With this type of rebase you can add new changes to the review as well when
pushing the rebased branch, as long as those new changes are in separate
commits.  The push is accepted as long as there is some commit on the rebased
branch that references the exact same tree as the current head of the review
branch.

Move Rebase
-----------

By selecting the "New Upstream / Move" alternative in the dialog and pressing
the "Continue" button, a new dialog is displayed asking you to specify which
upstream commit you intend to rebase the branch onto.  If you rebase using a
command like

  <code>git rebase --onto &lt;newbase&gt; &lt;upstream&gt;</code>

then the upstream commit you should specify is whatever "&lt;newbase&gt;" resolves
to.  If you rebase using a command like

  <code>git rebase &lt;upstream&gt;</code>

then the upstream commit you should specify is whatever "&lt;upstream&gt;" resolves
to.  Critic lets you specify the upstream commit either as a full 40-character
SHA-1 sum or by selecting a tag that references a suitable commit.  Abbreviated
SHA-1 sums or branch names are not accepted since it is possible that the commit
you intend to rebase onto doesn't exist in Critic's repository yet, or that your
local branch (even 'master') doesn't reference the same commit as Critic's
branch with the same names.  (It could be said that the same problem might exist
with tags, but it's much less likely.)

It's very important that you specify the correct upstream commit, or, if you
prepared the rebase before you performed it locally, that you actually rebase
onto the upstream commit you specified.  If the specified upstream commit is not
reachable from the commit you later push, the push is rejected.  If the
specified upstream commit is reachable from the commit you later push, the push
is accepted, even if you actually rebased on a different upstream commit; the
effect of this is that commits are added to the review that you didn't mean to
add, and that reviewing any conflict resolutions you did while rebasing becomes
more difficult.

It's also very important that you don't add any new changes to the rebased
branch before pushing.  Such changes, even if added as separate commits, will
not be directly visible in the review.  They will, if at all, show up as some
sort of conflict resolutions.  Critic simply assumes that the rebased branch you
push corresponds exactly to the current review branch, only rebased onto another
upstream commit.

Like with an in-place rebase, to finish the rebase you simply push the rebased
branch using

  <code>git push -f critic HEAD:r/&lt;name&gt;</code>

The push will automatically add a constructed "equivalent" merge commit to the
review.  This commit has as its parents the old head of the review branch and
the new upstream commit that you previous specified, and references the same
tree as the head of the rebased review branch.  The constructed merge is exactly
the same as you would get if you had merged the new upstream commit into the
review branch instead of rebasing onto it, and is used to let reviewers review
your resolutions to any conflicts that happened while rebasing the branch.

Review Front-page Additions
---------------------------

The branch log on the review front-page is rendered slightly differently once
the review branch has been rebased.  In fact, it's no longer strictly speaking a
branch log at all.  All commits that had been added to the review before the
review branch was rebased are still displayed, with whatever review status they
had before.  All issues and notes are still attached to these commits.

The point at which the rebase took place is signalled by a line that says either

  History rewritten by &lt;name&gt;

or

  Branch rebased by &lt;name&gt;

depending on the type of rebase.  The first (most recent) such line also
contains a link to the actual rebased/cleaned-up log of the branch.

Commits pushed to the review branch after the rebase are displayed above the
rebase signalling line.  Issues and notes should be transferred from the old
branch to the rebased branch automatically unless addressed by rebase, in which
case they would be marked as addressed by the constructed merge commit instead.
(An in-place rebase can't address open issues since the source tree can't be
modified.)
