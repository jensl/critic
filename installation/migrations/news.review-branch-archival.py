Review branch archival
======================

This Critic system now supports automatic archival of obsolete review branches.
This means that review branch refs that belong to reviews that are finished and
closed, or dropped, are eventually deleted from the repository.

For more information, see the [Review branch archival][tutorial]
tutorial.

From now on, archival of review branches is scheduled when reviews are closed or
dropped.  For each existing already closed or dropped reviews in this system,
archival will have been scheduled at a random time 2-6 weeks after the upgrade.
This news item's timestamp indicates when the upgrade took place.

NOTE: This update adds a review branch archival mechanism, enabled by
