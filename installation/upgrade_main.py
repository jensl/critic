WARNING: You're about to switch to an unstable development version of Critic!

If this is a production system, you are most likely better off staying on the

branch isn't it.

The latest stable branch is the default branch (i.e. HEAD) in Critic's GitHub
repository at

  https://github.com/jensl/critic.git

To interrogate it from the command-line, run

  $ git ls-remote --symref https://github.com/jensl/critic.git HEAD

HINT: If you installed from the 'master' branch prior to October 2017, then it
      was at that time a stable branch (and also the only available option.)
      At this point in time, a stable branch 'stable/1' was branched off, and
      'master' became an unstable development branch.

      In other words, if you are currently on 'master', you most likely want to
      switch to 'stable/1', or the latest stable branch (see above,) now.
