The Critic code review system
=============================

A Critic code review system hosts one or more Git repositories, often mirrors
of some authoritative source, and allows collaborative code review of commits
on branches in these repositories.

An example system can be found at https://critic-review.org/, where changes to
the Critic code review system itself are reviewed.
