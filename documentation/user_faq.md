Critic User FAQ
===============

### How can I create a code review for a subset of my topic branch? ###

Suppose that you've done 5 commits on a topic branch and that you
want to submit the first 3 to code review now and then continue work
on the topic branch.  After you've pushed the branch to Critic you
find it under the 'Branches' menu item in the top level menu.  Critic
will now show all the commits on your topic branch and there is a
button called 'Create Review', in the top right corner, that you
can use if you want to push the entire branch into code review.

If you want to push just a single commit into code review, you can
click that commit, and then click 'Create Review' on the subsequent
page.

However, at the branch page it's also possible to select a range of
commits to be pushed into review.  This is done by selecting
the desired commits using the mouse (i.e. click the first commit, hold
down the mouse and release over the last commit in the range).

### When reviewing code, how can I select some snippet or function name etc from the code and copy it to the clipboard? (i.e. it's not possible to select text because clicking to select triggers the 'New Issue' dialog) ###

Hold down the CTRL button while selecting.

### If I add myself as code reviewer for "src/flux/capacitor" I will get notified of all future code reviews touching that part of the code.  However, how can I also make sure that I become registered as reviewer for any currently active code reviews touching that same part of the code? ###
