Critic Tutorials
================

Most of Critic's documentation is available as tutorials available in the
installed system, accessed via the "Tutorial" link at the top of every page.

This documentation can also be read without installing Critic first, in the
public Critic system used to review Critic itself:

  http://critic-review.org/tutorial

They can also be found in source form in the tutorials/ directory.  The source
is in custom text-based format similar to the Markdown markup language.
